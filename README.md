He walked with me through by Kelley Reuer,Tyson Reuer,Philip Reuer,Kristi Reuer Book Review

Name: Todd Ford
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Of Grief and Gumbolillies
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2022
Review: One day, she was living her dream as the wife of a real life cowboy while raising three young children. The next instant, everything changed. Late one evening, Kelley's husband, Todd, was in a pasture, far from home and very far from emergency services. He and his young sons, Tyson and Philip, were gathering cows. They were tired. Exhausted. And one stubborn cow wasn't cooperating. They began to use a bit of reverse cow psychology (as described, it's quite clever) and it almost worked, but then, as described vividly by Tyson, the only eye-witness, that aforementioned everything-altering instant left Todd unconscious beneath his horse. He did regain consciousness. He did try to stand. But his answers to simple questions told Tyson and the soon arriving Kelley, who had been fetched by Philip, that something was terribly wrong.

He Walked With Me Through -- a collection of journal entries, poems, short fictions, and reminiscences by Kelley's three now adult children -- is raw. It covers the gamut of emotions. It's filled with anger, frustration, forgiveness. An especially painful episode describes Todd's post traumatic brain injury behavior during Tyson's junior rodeo. I'll just say he was no longer able to be the supportive dad he'd once been. It's happily not all bleak, though. I loved reading the story of how Kelley got the nickname "Gumbolilly." There‚Äôs also a joyous scene of Kelley and Todd chasing a jackrabbit down a darkened rural highway. But, alas, as I learned while writing my own memoirs, unpleasant memories have a way of stealing the show.

Yes, this is a book about grieving in all its many shapes and colors. And it's about how deep faith makes the walk, if not exactly bearable, at least one-step-at-a-time doable. The book, page after page, reminded me of an Internet meme I discovered once upon a time. It showed a broken heart in a water glass on the left side of the image and asked: "Over time, does grief shrink, occupying less and less of the glass?" Its answer: nope. Grief doesn't get smaller; its container grows. On the right side of the image was the same broken heart appearing tiny within a water pitcher.

My favorite of Kelley's many observations comes as she contemplates tombstones. They display a person's dates of birth and death, but she now realizes neither date is important. What matters and truly represents a life is the dash in between those dates. It symbolizes both how a life can seem to last but an instant and yet be filled with an infinity of cherished moments -- and it's those moments we must cherish.

Her recognition of the meaning of that short, simple mark etched in stone said to me she'll be okay -- until her Gumbolilly and Todd once again chase Jackrabbits. Her glass is well on its way to becoming one ginormous pitcher.

Title: A journey that will encourage and inspire
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2023
Review: It took me a while to read Kelley's book. The emotional intensity was overwhelming at times. I laughed and wept, and whispered 'Oh Jesus' multiple times. I rejoiced, marveled, and gave thanks for the amazing faithfulness of God. Then I passed it along to a friend whose current journey parallels Kelley's. I know it will encourage his heart, and the heart of any who read it.
